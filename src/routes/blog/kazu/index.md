# Kazu: a Japanese number training tool

Try it out: [http://sebpearce.com/kazu][app]

**EDIT (2014-03-08)**: I’ve done a complete revision of the design and features. [Have a look!][app]

I wrote this little app in my spartan basement suite apartment in Vancouver in autumn 2013.

It’s a tool to help people who are learning Japanese. Large numbers in Japanese are a pain for English-speakers (and vice-versa) because they’re grouped in 4s, not 3s &mdash; but only after you get above 1,000.

- 千 _sen_ = 1,000 (10<sup>3</sup>)
- 万 _man_ = 10,000 (10<sup>4</sup>)
- 億 _oku_ = 100,000,000 (10<sup>8</sup>)
- 兆 _chou_ = 1,000,000,000,000 (10<sup>12</sup>)

Compare this to our units of _thousand_, _million_ and _billion_.

- English: 100,000 (_a hundred thousand_)
- Japanese: 10 万 = 10,0000 (_ten man_)

Since I kept getting these wrong, I wrote an app to help. You can experiment by generating random numbers or typing in your own and seeing what they look like in Japanese.
